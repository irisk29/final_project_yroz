Manual tests plan:

We conducted manual tests for many of the aspects of the project.

Most of our user input constraints are only able to be checked via the UI as the constraints are part of the user interface code.

Therefore, we had to go through every screen and form that has such constraints to check the values are enforced.

Moreover, we have tested that our UI widgets do not overflow in many cellular devices.

Furthermore, to conduct a full physical purchase, there have to be two cellphones so these were also tested manually.
